# Redbus_web_scrapping
I used Selenium to scrape bus route names and details from redbus.in. The scraped data, including bus name, route, rate, and ratings, was stored in a MySQL database. I then developed a Streamlit web app to display and filter the data interactively. The app allows users to easily access and explore bus route information.
